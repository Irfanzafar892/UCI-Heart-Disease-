# UCI-Heart-Disease-
UCI Heart Disease Analysis with Python
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the UCI Heart Disease dataset, performed using Python. The goal of this project is to explore the dataset, conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), and implement predictive modeling techniques to better understand the factors contributing to heart disease.

Dataset
The UCI Heart Disease dataset consists of 303 instances and 14 attributes, including demographic and health-related variables. The dataset is widely used for research and educational purposes in the field of health informatics.

Key Attributes:
Age: Age of the patient
Sex: Gender of the patient
Chest Pain Type: Type of chest pain experienced
Resting Blood Pressure: Blood pressure measured at rest
Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: Maximum heart rate during exercise
Diagnosis: Presence or absence of heart disease
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
Key Features
Data Cleaning: Processed the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized relationships and trends within the data to gain insights.
Predictive Modeling: Built models to predict the presence of heart disease based on various features.
Interactive Visualizations: Created interactive graphs to present findings in an engaging manner.
Getting Started
Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-analysis.git
Navigate to the project directory:cd heart-disease-analysis
Install the required packages:pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook

Future Work
Enhance the predictive models by exploring additional algorithms.
Integrate the analysis with real-time data for more dynamic insights.
Develop a user-friendly dashboard for stakeholders.
